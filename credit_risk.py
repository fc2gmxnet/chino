shortfall to a targeted financial measure or value, such as a company\'s profit, earnings per share (EPS), or a household\'s retirement fund. The term is derived from the Italian word riscare ("to dare"), and in Chinese, it is represented by symbols meaning "danger" and "opportunity," reflecting that while risks can lead to losses, they are also necessary to obtain the competitive advantage required for profits.', 'According to Frank Knight and John Maynard Keynes, "risk" refers to measurable situations where the outcomes are unknown but the probabilities associated with each outcome can be quantified. In contrast, "uncertainty" (specifically Knightian or irreducible uncertainty) occurs when a decision-maker lacks enough information to determine all outcomes or their probabilities. This distinction is critical in finance, as the failure of risk models to recognize "Black Swan" events—high-impact, rare, and hard-to-predict events—was a major factor in the 2008–2009 global financial crisis.', 'Systematic risk, also called common risk, refers to factors that drive the valuation of all assets within an asset class. Idiosyncratic risk is unique to a specific issuer, such as a company-specific strike, patent infringement, or natural disaster at a manufacturing plant.', 'Systematic risk is considered "nondiversifiable" because it cannot be eliminated by creating a diversified portfolio. Conversely, idiosyncratic risk is "diversifiable" and can be eliminated through the proper selection and pooling of various assets. Financial theories suggest that in efficient markets, investors should only be compensated for accepting systematic risks, as idiosyncratic risks can be diversified away for free.', 'Financial risk management involves three sequential activities: (1) identifying financial risks, which is not always easy as some only become apparent after a crisis; (2) quantifying identified risks using probability and statistical metrics; and (3) evaluating how to deal with each risk through retention, neutralization, or transfer.', 'Entities can choose to retain the risk based on a cost-benefit analysis (this can be "unfunded," where losses are paid as they occur, or "funded," where money is set aside). They may neutralize the risk by acting on their own behalf to mitigate the outcome without a third party, such as through improved manufacturing processes or natural hedging (e.g., matching cash inflows and outflows in the same foreign currency). Finally, they can transfer the risk to a third party using insurance, derivatives, or structured finance instruments like asset securitization.', 'The text classifies financial risks into three broad categories: (1) Investment risk, (2) Funding risk (or financing risk), and (3) Systemic financial risk.', 'Investment risk is the likelihood that an investment or strategy will perform worse than expected. Its primary types include price risk (adverse price movements), credit risk (failure to fulfill obligations), reinvestment risk (lower returns on reinvested cash), inflation risk (loss of purchasing power), liquidity risk (high costs or price impact when trading), and foreign exchange-rate risk (adverse currency moves).', 'Financial derivatives provide for the efficient transfer of specific risks from those who wish to reduce exposure to those willing to accept it. Asset securitization is a structured finance process where a pool of loans (like mortgages or auto loans) is packaged into bonds and sold to the public, effectively transferring the associated credit risks from financial institutions to investors.', "Credit risk takes three forms: default risk (failure to meet contractual payments on a loan or bond), counterparty risk (failure of a party in a non-lending transaction like a derivative), and credit spread risk (the risk that market perception of an issuer's default risk worsens, causing bond prices to fall). It is measured through credit analysis of financial information, internal bank ratings, external agency ratings, and credit scoring models. It is controlled using instruments like credit derivatives, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and credit-linked notes.", 'Price risk is the risk of an adverse movement in an asset\'s price; for a long position, the risk is a price decrease, while for a short position, it is a price increase. Factor models (or asset pricing models) link an asset\'s price sensitivity to specific "risk factors" (variables that drive prices, like earnings for stocks or interest rates for bonds); an asset\'s exposure to a factor is known as its factor beta.', "The two key drivers that change a bond's price and determine its price sensitivity are the level of interest rates in the market (often benchmarked to U.S. Treasury rates) and the issuer's credit rating (or credit spread).", 'Funding risk (or financing risk) is the risk associated with obtaining funds. The four types are: (1) Leverage risk (the risks of using borrowed funds to boost returns), (2) Funding liquidity risk (the risk of being forced to settle obligations immediately when liquid assets or funding sources are unavailable), (3) Timing risk (the risk of issuing securities at an unfavorable time or interest rate), and (4) Fixed-floating financing risk (the risk that future interest rates will rise above a fixed-rate alternative when borrowing on a floating-rate basis).', 'Systemic risk is the risk that a sudden, unexpected disruption of information flows in financial markets prevents the channeling of funds to productive opportunities. It is often described as the risk that the failure of one participant may cause a chain reaction (contagion) of defaults, potentially leading to a broader collapse of the global financial system.', 'Innovation is classified in two main ways: (1) the Economic Council of Canada uses categories like market-broadening (improving liquidity/funding), risk-management (reallocating risk), and arbitraging (exploiting tax/regulatory differences); (2) the BIS suggests functional categories including price risk-transferring, credit risk-transferring, liquidity-generating, credit-generating, and equity-generating instruments.', 'An ABS is created through a process called asset securitization, where a pool of self-liquidating financial assets (like loans, leases, or receivables) serves as collateral for a new security. An originator (the entity that first granted the loans) sells these assets to a legal entity called a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). To fund this purchase, the SPV sells securities (certificates or notes) to investors, which are backed by the cash flows from the underlying loan pool .', 'The structure is defined by a "waterfall," which consists of rules for distributing interest, principal, and losses among different classes of securities called tranches . This often involves a senior-subordinated structure. In this setup, losses are absorbed first by the most junior (subordinated) tranches to protect the senior tranches . Higher-rated senior bonds are paid principal first, while subordinated bonds provide credit support .', 'The main parties include: (1) the Originator/Seller/Depositor, who initiates the loans and sells them to the SPV; (2) the Special-Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which acts as the issuer of the securities; (3) the Servicer, responsible for collecting payments from borrowers and managing delinquencies; and (4) the Trustee, who represents the interests of bondholders and ensures compliance with legal covenants .', 'Securitization facilitates financial disintermediation by allowing borrowers to raise funds directly from public markets rather than relying solely on banks . It performs three key economic functions: (1) maturity intermediation by creating bonds with various maturities (time tranching); (2) risk reduction through the diversification of a large pool of loans; and (3) lower contracting costs . Most importantly, it improves liquidity by turning illiquid assets into tradable securities.', 'In the originate-to-hold approach, a bank keeps the loan on its balance sheet and remains at risk for its performance, incentivizing rigorous due diligence . In the originate-to-distribute approach, a bank originates loans specifically to package them into a securitization . Because the credit risk is shifted to external investors, the bank may focus more on generating volume and fees than on the long-term credit quality of the loans .', 'The major concern is moral hazard. Since originators do not intend to hold the loans on their own balance sheets, they may lower their underwriting standards to approve as many loans as possible for the sake of fee income . This breakdown in credit evaluation was a significant factor in the subprime mortgage crisis.', 'Corporations can often raise funds at a lower cost through securitization than by issuing corporate bonds. By using an SPV to house the collateral, the credit risk of the securities is decoupled from the credit rating of the corporation itself. This allows highly rated tranches (e.g., Triple-A) to be issued even if the corporation has a much lower credit rating, thereby reducing the overall interest spread paid to investors .', 'The SPV is a legal entity critical for achieving bankruptcy remoteness. When an originator sells assets to an SPV in a "true sale," the assets legally belong to the SPV. If the originator later goes bankrupt, its creditors cannot claim the assets held by the SPV, ensuring that investors in the securitized bonds are protected and only need to evaluate the credit risk of the loan pool itself .', 'Modern regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and new EU frameworks, focus on four areas: (1) increasing transparency and disclosure in prospectuses; (2) requiring risk retention; (3) reforming credit rating agencies; and (4) imposing stricter capital requirements . These rules aim to ensure better due diligence on the underlying loans.', 'Risk-retention rules (often called "skin in the game") require the securitizer to hold a meaningful economic interest in the transaction—usually the "first-loss piece". The purpose is to align the incentives of the originator with those of the investors. If the underlying loans are poorly underwritten and default, the originator will suffer the first financial losses, thereby mitigating the moral hazard problem.', "Beyond funding, securitization is a risk management tool for: (1) Interest rate risk, by removing debt obligations from the balance sheet that would lose value if rates rise; (2) Credit risk, by transferring the risk of borrower default to investors; and (3) Residual risk, specifically in lease securitizations where the risk that the asset's end-of-term market value is lower than expected is passed on to bondholders .", 'A derivative is a financial instrument whose price or value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index (simply called the "underlying") . Its primary economic purpose is to act as a "risk transfer vehicle," allowing parties to control risk by transferring it to others willing to accept it .', 'Derivatives are broadly classified into four categories: futures, forwards, options, and swaps. While futures and forwards are the focus of this chapter, all four serve as mechanisms for risk management and transference.', 'A futures contract is a standardized agreement between a buyer and a seller where the buyer agrees to take delivery and the seller agrees to make delivery of an underlying at a specified price (futures price) at a designated future date (settlement date) . In jargon, the buyer is "long" and the seller is "short" .', 'The core function is to provide an efficient vehicle for transferring unwanted risk (such as stock price or interest rate volatility) to a party willing to accept it. This allows market participants to hedge their exposure to price fluctuations in the cash market .', 'Futures are standardized, exchange-traded, and governed by a clearinghouse that guarantees performance, resulting in minimal credit risk; they are also marked to market daily . Forwards are nonstandardized OTC instruments, negotiated individually, have no clearinghouse, carry significant counterparty credit risk, and are typically intended for actual delivery rather than being closed out before maturity .', 'The clearinghouse performs a "guarantee function" by interposing itself as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer, eliminating concerns about counterparty default . It also simplifies the process of "unwinding" (liquidating) positions by allowing parties to take offsetting positions without needing the consent of the original counterparty.', 'Investors must deposit initial margin (good faith money) to open a position. Each day, the position is marked to market using the settlement price, and gains or losses are reflected in the equity account. If equity falls below the maintenance margin, the investor must provide variation margin (in cash) to bring the account back to the initial margin level .', "Risk-sharing arrangements, like futures and forwards, have a symmetric or linear payoff. Every $1 change in the underlying's price results in an identical gain for one party and loss for the other. Both parties eliminate price risk but also give up the opportunity to benefit from favorable price movements .", 'Unlike risk-sharing, an insurance arrangement (like an option) has a nonlinear or asymmetric payoff. One party pays a premium to limit downside risk while retaining the ability to benefit from favorable price moves. Only the party providing the insurance is required to perform if the other party chooses to exercise the contract.', 'Broad-based index futures (like the S&P 500) are regulated by the SEC or CFTC . Narrow-based index futures involve a smaller group of stocks or concentrated weightings . Single-stock futures represent 100 shares of an individual company and require physical delivery at settlement .', 'Eurodollar futures are cash-settled based on the 3-month LIBOR with a $1 million notional value . Treasury Bond futures involve a hypothetical $100,000 par value, 6% coupon bond. Sellers have "delivery options" (quality, timing, and wild card) and typically deliver the "cheapest-to-deliver" issue .', 'Currency forwards are OTC agreements often used for delivery, while currency futures are standardized exchange-traded contracts. Both allow entities to hedge foreign exchange risk.', 'They act as an essential risk-transference mechanism. By providing leverage (allowing a large position with a small margin deposit), they make the cost of reducing price risk accessible to a wide range of market participants.', 'An option is a contract in which the writer (seller) grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the writer an underlying asset at a specified exercise (strike) price within a specific timeframe (until the expiration date) . The buyer pays the writer a fee known as the option price or premium.', 'A call option gives the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset from the writer. A put option gives the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset to the writer. The buyer of a call benefits if the price rises, while the buyer of a put benefits if the price falls.', 'An option is a derivative because its value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index. It acts as an insurance arrangement to transfer risk from the option buyer to the writer .', 'American options can be exercised at any time up to and including the expiration date. European options can only be exercised on the expiration date. Bermuda options (or Atlantic options) can be exercised only on several specified dates plus the expiration date.', 'Exchange-traded options are standardized (strike price, quantity, expiration), have lower transaction costs, and are guaranteed by a clearinghouse that eliminates counterparty risk . OTC options are customized (tailor-made) for institutional needs and carry counterparty credit risk but allow for flexibility in the underlying asset and exercise terms .', "In a futures contract, both parties are obligated to perform, creating a symmetric (linear) risk/reward profile where gains and losses are dollar-for-dollar . In an options contract, only the writer is obligated; the buyer has a right, creating an asymmetric (nonlinear) payoff where the buyer's loss is limited to the premium, while the upside is substantial .", '1. Long Call: Limited loss (premium), unlimited upside . 2. Short Call: Limited gain (premium), unlimited downside . 3. Long Put: Limited loss (premium), substantial upside (if price falls to zero). 4. Short Put: Limited gain (premium), substantial downside .', 'Options serve as an insurance arrangement for risk transfer. Unlike futures, which lock in a price and eliminate both risk and reward, options allow an investor to protect against adverse price movements while still benefiting from favorable ones .', 'Exchanges provide a centralized, competitive auction market, standardize contract terms to ensure liquidity, and utilize a clearinghouse to guarantee performance, effectively removing the direct link between buyer and seller and eliminating counterparty risk .', 'A long call position limits the maximum loss to the premium paid, whereas a long position in the asset has dollar-for-dollar downside . By replacing an asset position with options, an investor can define a maximum floor for losses while maintaining upside participation, though the ultimate profit is reduced by the cost of the premium.', 'These are options where the underlying is a stock index (e.g., S&P 500, Nasdaq 100). They use a contract multiple (e.g., $100 for S&P 100) to determine the dollar value of the index . Because the underlying index cannot be physically delivered, these options are cash-settled based on the difference between the strike index and the actual index value .', 'These can be written on cash debt instruments (options on physicals) or on interest rate futures . OTC interest rate options are widely used for Treasury securities, agency debentures, and mortgage-backed securities to hedge interest rate or yield spread volatility .', 'Exotic options are complex OTC derivatives customized for specific institutional needs. Examples include: (1) Alternative (either-or) options, which pay based on the better-performing of two assets ; and (2) Outperformance options, which pay based on the relative performance of two portfolios .', 'A futures option gives the buyer the right to enter into a long or short position in a specific futures contract at the exercise price . Upon exercise, the parties receive a futures position marked-to-market at the current futures price, and the difference is settled in cash . They are popular because they are "cleaner" than physical options and use highly liquid futures prices for valuation.', 'An FRA is the over-the-counter equivalent of exchange-traded interest rate futures. It is a contract where two parties agree to buy or sell funds on a future settlement date at a specified contract rate. The benchmark for calculating payments is the notional amount, which is never actually exchanged . The contract is cash-settled based on the present value of the difference between the market settlement rate (usually LIBOR) and the contract rate.', 'An interest rate swap is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange periodic interest payments based on a notional principal amount . In a "plain vanilla" swap, one party (the fixed-rate payer) makes fixed payments, while the other (the floating-rate payer) makes payments that vary with a reference rate like LIBOR . Only the net interest differential is exchanged.', 'They are primarily used for Asset/Liability (A/L) Management and Debt Issuance. For example, a bank with fixed-rate assets but floating-rate liabilities can use a swap to pay fixed and receive floating, thereby locking in a spread and neutralizing interest rate risk.', 'Growth is driven by the fact that swaps are a quick, transactionally efficient way to change the nature of assets and liabilities or to exploit capital market imperfections. They offer longer maturities (15+ years) than futures and are highly liquid, often more so than long-dated forward contracts .', 'The value of a swap fluctuates with market rates. A fixed-rate payer realizes a profit if interest rates rise (as they pay a below-market rate) and a loss if they fall. Conversely, the floating-rate payer gains when rates decrease and loses when they increase.', "1. Package of Forward Contracts (FRAs): A swap is seen as a series of FRAs, each with a different settlement date but the same contract rate . 2. Package of Cash Market Instruments: A fixed-rate payer's position is equivalent to being long a floating-rate bond and short (borrowing) a fixed-rate bond .", 'The market originated from credit arbitrage opportunities. This is based on the principle of comparative advantage, where a high-rated borrower might have a greater advantage in the fixed-rate market than the floating-rate market compared to a lower-rated borrower. Both parties benefit by issuing debt where they have a comparative advantage and swapping for their preferred payment type .', 'The swap spread (the difference between the swap rate and the Treasury yield) is determined by: (1) the level and shape of the Treasury yield curve; (2) the supply and demand balance of fixed vs. floating-rate payers; (3) asset-based swap activity; and (4) technical factors affecting swap dealers.', 'A swaption is an option on an interest rate swap. It grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a swap at a specified strike rate on or before a future date . A payer swaption allows the holder to enter as a fixed-rate payer, while a receiver swaption allows them to enter as a fixed-rate receiver .', 'A forward start swap is a contract where the counterparties agree to the terms of a swap today, but the actual exchange of interest payments begins at a designated future date.', 'This is a "structured" swap where one counterparty makes payments based on a floating interest rate, while the other makes payments tied to the performance of a stock index or common stock.', 'These are agreements where one party, for an upfront premium, agrees to compensate the other if a reference rate hits a strike rate. A cap pays the buyer if the rate exceeds the strike (protecting against rising rates), while a floor pays if the rate falls below the strike (protecting against falling returns) .', 'Borrowers use caps to establish a ceiling on funding costs for floating-rate debt. Investors use floors to establish a minimum return on floating-rate assets or to lock in a minimum interest rate spread. FRAs are used to hedge short-term interest rate exposure for a single future period.', 'Caps and floors are essentially packages of interest rate options. A cap is a series of call options on interest rates (or put options on a bond), while a floor is a series of put options on interest rates (or call options on a bond) .', 'An interest rate collar is created by buying an interest rate cap and simultaneously selling an interest rate floor . This narrows the range of potential interest rate outcomes.

Examples include credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations.', 'A credit derivative is an over-the-counter (OTC) financial contract whose value is derived from the credit performance of one or more "reference entities" (issuers) or "reference obligations" (specific bonds/loans). It allows for the isolation and trading of credit risk separately from other risks, such as interest rate or currency risk.', 'The primary purpose is to manage and hedge credit risk. For banks, they provide a way to reduce credit concentration without damaging client relationships (since the loan stays on the books). For investors, they provide a way to take a "synthetic" credit position or express a view on the creditworthiness of an entity without owning its physical debt.', 'They are classified into unfunded and funded instruments. The most common type is the Credit Default Swap (CDS). Other types include Total Return Swaps, where the total economic performance of an asset is exchanged, and Credit Spread Options, which pay out based on changes in the yield spread of a credit relative to a benchmark.', 'Credit events are the triggers for payment in a credit derivative, typically standardized by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). Common events include: (1) Bankruptcy, (2) Failure to Pay, and (3) Restructuring. Other events can include obligation acceleration, obligation default, and repudiation/moratorium.', 'A CDS is the most widely used credit derivative. The protection buyer makes periodic premium payments (the "spread") to the protection seller. If a credit event occurs on the reference entity, the seller compensates the buyer for the loss in value of the reference obligation. It functions similarly to an insurance policy against default.', 'Single-name CDS covers a single reference entity. Basket CDS covers a small group of entities, where payment is triggered by the first (first-to-default), second, or nth default in the pool. A CDS Index (like CDX or iTraxx) is a standardized basket of a large number of entities (often 125), allowing for broad-based credit risk trading.', 'A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) is a structured product where a pool of debt is used as collateral to issue new securities. A Collateralized Bond Obligation (CBO) is a CDO specifically backed by a pool of corporate or sovereign bonds. A Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) is a CDO backed primarily by a pool of leveraged bank loans.', 'While both use pooling and tranching, an ABS usually involves a pool of many small, homogeneous assets like residential mortgages or credit card receivables. A CDO typically involves a pool of larger, heterogeneous corporate debts (bonds or loans) and is often actively managed by a collateral manager who can trade assets within the pool.', 'Assets are held by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which issues securities in tranches: (1) Senior tranches (AAA/AA) have the first claim on cash flows and highest credit protection; (2) Mezzanine tranches (A to BB) provide a buffer; and (3) the Equity or Residual tranche (unrated) is the "first-loss piece" that absorbs initial defaults but receives the highest potential return.', 'Arbitrage CDOs are created by investment banks or managers to profit from the "spread" between the higher yield on the collateral and the lower cost of funding the tranches. Balance sheet CDOs are created by banks to remove assets (loans) from their balance sheets to achieve regulatory capital relief or manage risk.', 'The goal is to capture the arbitrage spread. The manager buys high-yield assets and finances them by issuing low-yield senior debt. After paying interest to bondholders and management fees, the remaining "excess spread" is distributed to the equity tranche investors.', 'Banks use them to reduce their Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), which lowers the amount of regulatory capital they must hold. This frees up capital for new lending or other business activities. It also provides a way to diversify or limit exposure to specific sectors or borrowers.', "In a synthetic CDO, the SPV does not physically buy the underlying bonds or loans. Instead, it takes on the credit risk by selling protection via Credit Default Swaps (CDS) on a reference portfolio. The premiums received from the CDS, along with interest from high-quality collateral (like Treasuries), are used to pay the CDO's investors."]}
